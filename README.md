# Learning java OOP for school
School java coding 

We’ll want projects that force you to use:

    Classes & Objects

    Encapsulation

    Inheritance

    Polymorphism

    Interfaces / Abstract classes

    Collections & Generics

    Basic Design Patterns

Here’s a progressive list that will help you refresh everything while staying hands-on:
Phase 1 – OOP Fundamentals

These are small but concept-heavy:

    Library Management System

        Classes: Book, Member, Librarian, Library.

        Features: Add/remove/search books, issue/return books.

        OOP focus: Encapsulation, aggregation (Library has many Books), and inheritance (Staff → Librarian).

    Bank Account Simulation

        Classes: Account (abstract), SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount.

        Features: Deposit, withdraw, interest calculation.

        OOP focus: Inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding.

    Student Gradebook

        Classes: Student, Course, Gradebook.

        Features: Add courses, assign grades, calculate GPA.

        OOP focus: Composition, collections (ArrayList / HashMap).

Phase 2 – Applying OOP with Complexity

Here we bring in interfaces, abstract classes, and design patterns.
4. Restaurant Ordering System

    Classes: MenuItem, Order, Customer.

    Use an interface for Payable (cash, card, online payment).

    OOP focus: Interfaces, polymorphism, strategy pattern (different payment types).

    Shape Drawing App (console or simple GUI with JavaFX/Swing)

        Classes: Shape (abstract), Circle, Rectangle, Triangle.

        Feature: Calculate area/perimeter, draw shapes.

        OOP focus: Abstract classes, overriding, polymorphism.

    Vehicle Rental System

        Classes: Vehicle (abstract), Car, Bike, Truck.

        Feature: Rent/return vehicles, price calculation by type.

        OOP focus: Inheritance, overriding, abstract methods, generics for managing collections.

Phase 3 – Full Project Simulation

This is where you simulate a mini real-world app to combine everything.
7. E-Commerce Simulation

    Classes: Product, Customer, Cart, Order, Payment (interface), and CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment implementations.

    Features: Add/remove products from cart, checkout, apply discounts.

    OOP focus: All major principles + clean architecture.

    School Management System

        Classes: Person (abstract), Student, Teacher, Course, Grade.

        Features: Assign courses to teachers, enroll students, record grades.

        OOP focus: Large-scale use of encapsulation, inheritance, collections, and design patterns.
